  <title>Why I Like Dogs</title>

<h1> Dogs</h1>

<p>

  I like dogs because they are friendly, loyal, and full of energy. Dogs can make

  people feel happy just by wagging their tail or running around with excitement.

  They enjoy playing outside, going for walks, and spending time with their

  owners. Every dog has a different personality, which makes them fun to learn

  about. Some dogs are calm and gentle, while others are playful and silly. Dogs

  can also be very smart and learn tricks or commands. Being around dogs makes

  me feel relaxed and cheerful because they always seem happy to see you.
